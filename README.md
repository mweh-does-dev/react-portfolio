This is my first website made with React and Tailwind CSS.



## ðŸŒ¸ About Me ðŸŒ¸
I'm an aspiring UX developer with an eye for detail and passion for quality. When I'm not studying at Chas Academy or working on my own projects, you'll find me gaming with some music in my headphones and my cat Alice on my lap.
The love for programming is something I've recently started to pursue, but my interest in design has been with me for a long time.
